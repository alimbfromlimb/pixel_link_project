# Testing Pixellink

In order to read from an image one may first use a segmentation algorithm to extract patches with text, and then apply a "reading" algorithm directly to the extracted areas. The goal of the project was to study how well a novel image-segmentation algorithm Pixellink (https://github.com/ZJULearning/pixel_link) works in collaboration with some "reading" algorithms. Here you can find the report (in Russian).
