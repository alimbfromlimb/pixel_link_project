here are some of the scripts I wrote while working on Pixellink project:

- delete_me.ipynb    was written to delete all the lines containing symbols aside from English alphabet and numbers from a given document
- pixel_link_crop.ipynb    crops images and creates a text to be fed to ocr
- my_model.py    I slightly changed the output to see levenshtein and normallized levenshtein distance.
